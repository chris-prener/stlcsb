The goal of `stlcsb` is to provide access to data from the City of St. Louis [Citizensâ€™ Service Bureau](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/public-safety/neighborhood-stabilization-office/citizens-service-bureau/index.cfm) (CSB), the [3-1-1 service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1) for the City of Saint Louis. Residents can contact the number with non-emergency service requests, and the CSB will dispatch these requests to the appropriate City agency. `stlcsb` also includes functions for cleaning and manipulating these data.

## Quick Start
If the `sf` package is already installed, the development version of `stlcsb` can be accessed from GitHub with `remotes`:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/stlcsb")
```

## Resources
In addition to instructions for installation, the main [Get started](articles/stlcsb.html) article has:

  * some tips on installing `stlcsb` and its dependencies,
  * a quick overview of data acquisition,
  * an overview of the functions available in `stlcsb`,
  * and a full example of the `stlcsb` workflow along with some basic mapping of these data.
