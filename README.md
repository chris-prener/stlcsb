# stlcsb

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/stlcsb)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stlcsb)

The goal of `stlcsb` is to provide access to data from the City of
St. Louis [Citizens’ Service
Bureau](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/public-safety/neighborhood-stabilization-office/citizens-service-bureau/index.cfm)
(CSB), which functions as a [3-1-1 like
service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1). Residents can contact the
number with non-emergecy service requests, and the CSB will forward
these requests to the appropriate City agency. `stlcsb` also includes
functions for cleaning and manipulating these data.

## Installation

You can install `stlcsb` from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("slu-openGIS/stlcsb")
```
