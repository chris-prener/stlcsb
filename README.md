The goal of `stlcsb` is to provide access to data from the City of
St. Louis [Citizens’ Service
Bureau](https://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/public-safety/neighborhood-stabilization-office/citizens-service-bureau/index.cfm)
(CSB), the [3-1-1 service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-1-1) for the
City of Saint Louis. Residents can contact the number with non-emergency
service requests, and the CSB will dispatch these requests to the
appropriate City agency. `stlcsb` also includes functions for cleaning
and manipulating these data.

## Installation

### Installing Dependencies

You should check the [`sf` package
website](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) and the [`areal` package
website](https://slu-openGIS.github.io/areal/) for the latest details on
installing dependencies for that package. Instructions vary
significantly by operating system. For best results, have `sf` installed
before you install `areal`. Other dependencies, like `dplyr`, will be
installed automatically with `areal` if they are not already present.

### Installing stlcsb

The development version of `stlcsb` can be accessed from GitHub with
`remotes`:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("slu-openGIS/stlcsb")
```
